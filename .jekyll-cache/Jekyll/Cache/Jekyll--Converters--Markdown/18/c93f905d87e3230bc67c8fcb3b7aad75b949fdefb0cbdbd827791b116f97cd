I"ˆ<p>I am a postdoc working in Daniel Cohenâ€™s group at Princeton University, supported in part by a <a href="https://njacts.rbhs.rutgers.edu/">NJ ACTS translational science fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, I developed the SCHEEPDOG electro-bioreactor that stimulates tissues with DC electric fields.
SCHEEPDOG hacks electrotaxis - the natural ability for many cells to sense and follow DC electric fields - to herd cells in a petri dish, as a sheepdog herds sheep.</p>

<p>I care deeply about engineering education, and have worked on several curriculum development projects to broaden participation in engineering, especially in electronics.</p>
