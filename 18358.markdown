# Course Description
This course aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of amateur radio. It is designed to prepare students to pass the amateur radio licensing exam, with an emphasis on hands-on demonstrations on what can be done with a radio license.

This course welcomes anyone interested in becoming a licensed amateur radio user, regardless of major or prior background.
