## Special Topics in Communication - Principles of Amateur Radio

# Course Description
This course aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of amateur radio. It is designed to prepare students to pass the amateur radio licensing exam, with an emphasis on hands-on demonstrations on what can be done with a radio license.
Though the class material focuses on the entry-level Technician exam, students have the opportunity to obtain the more advanced General and Extra class licenses which come with more privileges.
Topics covered include: Radio signal fundamentals, basic electronics, radio wave propagation, antennas, radio equipment, norms of amateur radio communication, and operating regulations.
This course welcomes anyone interested in becoming a licensed amateur radio user, regardless of major or prior background.
