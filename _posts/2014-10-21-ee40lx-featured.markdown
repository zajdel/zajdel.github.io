We worked with Texas Instruments on our upcoming Analog Circuits course EE40LX.
They wrote a feature about it on their E2E blog: [Berkeley MOOC offers hardware-based engineering training](https://e2e.ti.com/blogs_/archives/b/designproject/archive/2014/10/16/berkeley-mooc-offers-hardware-based-engineering-training-for-all).
