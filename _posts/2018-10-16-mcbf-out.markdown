Our paper, "PEDOT:PSS-based Multilayer Bacterial-Composite Films for Bioelectronics" is now out in *Scientific Reports*.
This project started with a random conversation over coffee with Moshe Baruch and Gábor Méhes at the Molecular Foundry at LBL. 
Gábor was here from Linkoping University, visiting Caroline Ajo-Franklin's lab for several months, to work on getting *Shewanella oneidensis* to play with PEDOT:PSS.
We ended up electropolymerizing the organic conductor around living bacteria to create a multilayer conductive bacterial-composite film (MCBF for short).
I'm proud about how this ended up coming together!
