I worked on automating a scanner and linear actuator for a colorimetric assay for external electron transfer efficiency, as well as image processing for this paper: "Modifying Cytochrome *c* Maturation Can Increase the Bioelectronic Performance of Engineered *Escherichia coli*," out now in *ACS Synthetic Biology*.
This was a fun collaboration with Caroline Ajo-Franklin's group at the Molecular Foundry at LBL!
