After growing up near Cincinnati, OH, I attended (The) Ohio State University, where I graduated with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with concentrations in electromagnetics and digital signal processing.
My thesis worked on cochlear implant speech processing, implementing asynchronous interleaved stimulation, in an attempt to improve the perception of intonation for cochlear implant users.

I moved to California for my PhD in EECS from UC Berkeley, working with Professor Michel Maharbiz on interfacing bacteria and electronics for biosensing.
While at Cal, I also taught and developed curricula for courses in electronic circuits, amateur radio, and introductory mechanics, including a massively open online course about electronics.

Now I'm at Princeton University, working in Daniel Cohen's Biointerfaces group, where I build devices to electrically stimulate tissues to control their growth and movement in vitro.

When I'm not in the lab or classroom, I enjoy running, playing board games, goofing around with radios, and listening to [Kurt](/img/kurt.jpg) (my pet hamster) exercise at night.
