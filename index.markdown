I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at Carnegie Mellon ECE.

Recently, I was postdoc working in Daniel Cohen's group at Princeton University, supported in part by a [NJ ACTS translational science fellowship](https://njacts.rbhs.rutgers.edu/). 
While at Princeton, I developed the SCHEEPDOG electro-bioreactor that stimulates tissues with DC electric fields.
SCHEEPDOG hacks electrotaxis - the natural ability for many cells to sense and follow DC electric fields - to herd cells in a petri dish, as a sheepdog herds sheep.

I care deeply about engineering education, and am working on curriculum projects to broaden participation in engineering, especially in electronics. I particularly enjoy radio and wireless as a motivating application for teaching ECE.
