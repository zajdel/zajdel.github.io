## Previous Projects
# *EE40LX*: Analog circuits MOOC for all
<img width="700" title="EE40LX: Electronic Interfaces" src="/img/ee40lx_banner.png">

With [Prof. Michel Maharbiz](https://maharbizgroup.wordpress.com/), I co-taught *EE40LX*, a lab-based massive open online course (MOOC) about analog electronics which ran from 2015-2016.
The purpose of this course was to introduce the fundamentals of electronics to a broad global audience.
By following along with the course, students built a simple robot from scratch using a microcontroller and common electronics parts and houshold items.
Over 80000 students enrolled from over 190 nations, and >2200 students completed the course, [with >850 robots built](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ee40lx+robot).

# *Applied Electrical I*: Practical laboratory curriculum for technicians
<img width="700" title="EE40LX: Electronic Interfaces" src="/img/nortec_banner.PNG">

During spring 2016, I consulted with [ZAMITA](https://lkdfacility.org/zamita-zambia/) to develop hands-on 
laboratory curriculum to teach practical electronics to
mechanics-in-training in Zambia's Northern Technical College (NORTEC). The course used best practices in 
problem-based learning to develop prototyping and circuit debugging skills to prepare trainees for entry in the growing excavation and transport industries.
I also facilitated an on-site workshop with instructors on laboratory pedagogy and lecturing techniques for this material.
