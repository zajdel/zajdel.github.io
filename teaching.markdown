<!--I believe that design experiences enrich students from all disciplines, from biology to the humanities, 
because design makes us engage in critical thinking about technology and its influence on the society that shapes us. 

## Projects
# *EE40LX*: Analog circuits MOOC for the world

# *Applied Electrical I*: Practical laboratory curriculum for heavy machinery technicians
